# rgitst (Rust Git Status)

This unimaginatively named project aims to be a pure Rust implementation of
other widely available tools such as
[gitHUD](https://github.com/gbataille/gitHUD/ "gitHUD"),
[git-radar](https://github.com/michaeldfallen/git-radar "git-radar") and
[git-prompt](https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt "git-prompt").

I've just started work on this, and as such one of the primary goals of this
project is to help me advance my learning of the Rust language. It does not aim
to reinvent the wheel and will have most of the same features found in many of
the aforementioned tools.
